	ChangeAgent is an app framework that is a one-stop shop for any grassroots cause. It will help your supporters find each other, organize, convince their friends to get involved and stay safe from overreach and violence. We're bringing together some great makers and thinkers from the hacker world and the world of progressive politics to make it happen.</br></br>
		
	How can grassroots causes compete with big money campaigns that play dirty? If the Cambridge Analyticas of this world can deliver targeted, manipulative messages to millions, how can we fight them? And can we compete without compromising our ethics and violating GDPR ourselves?</br></br>
	
	By helping our supporters convince their friends based on what they themselves know about them. We're not collecting any of this data, and we're open about the process. 	We also help supporters find each other based on location, and get involved in campaigning together. We have end-to-end encrypted messaging in-app, as well as an ephemeral, open local chat. We have panic buttons and other safety measures, as well as a way to contact the nearest coordinator with a single push of a button.

    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
		  
    <p class="wide_column">
  <img src="images/jenny.png" width="175" align="left" style="padding-right:20px" style="padding-top:20px"> <b>Jenny</b> is a young progressive in a small town. She doesn't know any other progressives and feels isolated. She's shy and going to a meeting in a nearby city with politically motivated strangers scares her, but she would like to find a way to help a cause.</br></br>

When Jenny downloaded <i>ChangeAgent</i>, she met others in a similar situation thanks to the <i>local chat</i>. It turned out there are several people in her town who would also like to help a progressive cause. They got together and started brainstorming about what they could do for their town. Jenny also used the <i>contact nearest coordinator</i> button on ChangeAgent to get in touch with existing structures and got some logistics help from Matt, the regional coordinator for the area.</br></br>
	  
<img src="images/greg.png" width="175" align="left" style="padding-right:20px" style="padding-top:20px"> <b>Greg</b> is working on a construction site. He knows there are many levels of intermediaries between the laborers and the site owner, who each get a cut. The frequent rotation of workers from site to site makes it difficult to organise and demand better wages and hours. If only the workers had a structure that would help them negotiate directly with the building developer they could get far better wages and working conditions by cutting out intermediaries.</br></br>
With a <i>ChangeAgent</i> instance, construction workers in the entire country could self-organise regardless of what site they currently work at. Greg is especially happy about the fact that <i>ChangeAgent</i> makes it easy to organise events, vote and raise money. As an admin, he can also send alerts to anyone in an area for spontaneous gatherings.</br></br>
</br>

<img src="images/pete.png" width="175" align="left" style="padding-right:20px" style="padding-top:20px"><b>Pete</b> works with Greg at the construction site, and he thinks Greg has a lot of great ideas. But he has a family to feed and doesn't want to make waves with the bosses. </br></br>He was relieved when Greg explained to him that ChangeAgent has <i>domain fronting</i> - that is, the network operator can't see that you're connecting to its server. So even if Pete accidentally connects in the work wifi, the bossess won't know that he's supporting the movement.
</br></br>
<img src="images/agnieszka.png" width="175" align="left" style="padding-right:20px" style="padding-top:20px"><b>Agnieszka</b> lives in a country with mid-level surveillance capabilities and has concerns about rapidly diminishing civil liberties. She would like to get people involved in direct action, but has concerns about repercussions. </br></br>She decided to use <i>ChangeAgent</i> to coordinate, because the app is <i>stateless</i> - if anyone's phone gets seized the app will not show what they have been doing in it. She also likes the fact that all chats are <i>ephemeral</i> - the contents dissapear after a short time, and that no personal data is being collected by the <i>ChangeAgent</i> server. The app also has a <i>panic button</i>, in case any of the participants finds themselves in physical danger.
